After taking different roles in IT departments over ten years,I realized data was the most interesting toping for me.  Working as data specialist I realized that  we do collect data wheather to analyse it or just to keep the records, but we dont use it to full benefits. This made me to learn more about data analysis. 


This portfolio contains some examples of the projects I have completed. To reach the site please click on the link below.
